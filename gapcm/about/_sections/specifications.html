  <p>A game PCM file is divided into 2048-byte sectors.</p>
  <p>The first sector is the header. 2 bytes for format, 4 bytes for loop start
position (mark), 4 bytes for length, 11 bytes for echo parameters, one byte for
pregap, and the rest should be zeroes. Following the m68k, multibyte integers
are stored in big-endian order.</p>
  <p>The remaining sectors make up the PCM stream. Each 8-bit sample is preceded
by eight zero-padding bits, totaling to 1024 samples per sector. For stereo
streams, an even-numbered<sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup> sector has samples
for the left, then the next one for the right. Therefore, two sectors are
required to reconstruct 1024 stereo samples.</p>
  <p>Each sample is a sign-magnitude representation of the range [−128, 127].
[0x00, 0x7f] maps to [−1, −128], and [0x80, 0xff] maps to [0, 127], in which
0xff or 127 is used as the loop stop control. They are played back at 16276 Hz
or one-768th of ~12.5 MHz--at least on original hardware. Emulators and alike
running at 60 Hz framerate play them at 16297 Hz.<sup><a href="#note-2">[2]</a

>this VGM Preservation Foundation wiki</a>], though we must correct that the
length header field measures in frames, not samples.</p>
