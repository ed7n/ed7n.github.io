<section>
  <p>{{data["gapcm"].body.title}} is a collection of programs that transcode
(convert) PCM files found in the original releases of <i>Lunar: Eternal Blue</i>
by [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://www.gamearts.co.jp">GAME ARTS</a>] and [<{{htmlAOut}}
"https://www.workingdesigns.com">Working Designs</a>]. Those files were designed
for the Ricoh RF5C164 in the Mega-CD, and thus are not conventionally usable
outside the game. While there are existing solutions, ours is standalone with
openly accessible source code, and has no GUI constraints.</p>
  <p>The project consists of three applications and one library. Binaries for
Debian and Windows are provided, but the source code should compile in any
modern POSIX-compliant environment with [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://www.gnu.org/software/make"
>GNU Make</a>].</p>
