<p>This Weebly domain was first conceived in 2014 for a Chemistry project in
high school. ({{"2016-10-15" | date: formDate}}) I then recycled it to host a
personal music portal, which lasted for a couple of years until ({{"2018-03-13"
| date: formDate}}) I brought it down and left it dormant for a while, before
eventually becoming what it is today.</p>
<p>For some reason, Weebly replaced some em dashes (â€”) to two hyphens (--).</p>
