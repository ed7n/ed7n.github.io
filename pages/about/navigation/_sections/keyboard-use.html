<p>Aside from the usual keys for navigation, you can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd
><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> to cycle the cursor over focusable
elements, including links.</p>
<p>The page menu is placed to be accessible with the keyboard. After a page is
loaded, a single <kbd>Tab</kbd> (Standard or <i>mini!</i>) or <kbd><kbd
>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> (Mobile) focuses on said menu. On the latter,
this is equivalent to tapping on the <kbd><samp>{{navLabelTree}}</samp></kbd>
button, and once its corresponding menu appears, use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select
the topmost option.</p>
<p>Finally--and this applies to a lot of places--you can use <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd
>+<kbd>←</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd></kbd> to go backward
and forward one page, respectively.</p>
