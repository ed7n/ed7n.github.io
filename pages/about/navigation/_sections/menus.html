  <h3>Page Menu</h3>
  <p>Each page comes with a menu of links to its sections and logical parents.
Its labels may be limited to two short or one long word, so they do not always
reflect the actual titles of their references.</p>
  <p>The location of the page menu depends on the current [{%include a-page.html
key="_about_layouts" html="document layout"%}]:</p>
  <ul class="headered">
    <li><span
>Standard, <i>mini!</i>, or Print</span><span
>Under the header; scroll up and look for <samp>{{navLabelPage}}</samp>.</span
></li>
    <li><span

>Tap on the <kbd><samp>{{navLabelTree}}</samp></kbd> button at the bottom-left
of the visible area.</span></li>
