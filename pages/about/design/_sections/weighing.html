<p>In hopes to reduce information overload and/or pollution, we use two
heuristics to limit the amount of page content.</p>
<p>The first uses the page menu as an indicator, such that--under our standard
rendering environment--its items must span only a single row.</p>
<p>The second limits the number of menu items to six per page.</p>
<p>The limit is reached when one of the two conditions is met.</p>
<p>Of course, a menu item can correspond to a long section, so this solution is
imperfect.</p>
