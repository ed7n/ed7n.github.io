<p>We want to ease the reader's eyes with a readable contrast. Colors must not
be too contrasting to discomfort, but they must also be quickly distinguishable
from one another.</p>
<p>The {{siteClass}} uses one of two opposing color schemes: <i>light</i> and <i
>dark</i>, [{%include a-page.html key="_about_color-scheme" html="depending on
the user preference"%}]. Their colors differ only by their lightness to be
consistent with their denotations.</p>
