<p>Being a mainly-informational website, we space elements like a text document.
Thankfully, HTML was originally built for our purposes.</p>
<p>An inline margin is applied to each page to limit its width. This simulates
the ratio of a document in portrait orientation, which in turn means less eye
movements than the conventional website.</p>
<p>Whitespace characters are used as spacers where appropriate. Selectable
trailing and leading whitespace characters are avoided for clutter-free text.
You can try selecting the entire page and inspect the highlights to verify
this.</p>
