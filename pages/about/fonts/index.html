    <p>While the {{siteClass}} is designed to be font-neutral, you can use our
set of fonts to match.</p>

    <h3>Sans-Serif</h3>
    <p>Our Workstation uses Cantarell, a contemporary Humanist sans serif used
by the GNOME project for its user interface.</p>
    <p>You can obtain its OpenType font (OTF) files:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>[<{{htmlAOut}}"https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/fonts-cantarell/download"
>Download fonts-cantarell</a>] from the Debian unstable repository.</li>
      <li>Extract the package as well as <code>data.tar</code> within it.</li>
      <li>Find them in <code>/data/usr/share/fonts/opentype/cantarell/</code
>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Fixed-Width (Monospace)</h3>
    <p>Our Workstation uses Hack, an excellent drop-in replacement to its
assumed-dead Bitstream Vera and DejaVu parents.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hack is designed to be a workhorse typeface for source code. It has
deep roots in the free, open source typeface community and expands upon the
contributions of the Bitstream Vera &amp; DejaVu projects. The large x-height +
wide aperture + low contrast design make it legible at commonly used source code
text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in the 8 - 14 range.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You can obtain its TrueType (TTF) or Web Open Font Format (WOFF) font
files by downloading your preferred latest release package from their [<{{
htmlAOut}}"https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/releases">Git repository</a
>].</p>
