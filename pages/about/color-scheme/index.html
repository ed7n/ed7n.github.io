    <p>This website follows your color scheme preference provided by your user
agent, which may have inherited this setting from your graphical environment.
Standard options include <kbd><samp>Light</samp></kbd> and <kbd><samp>Dark</samp
></kbd>, and are sometimes represented as a <kbd><samp>Dark Mode</samp></kbd>
toggle switch. Refer to your user agent's documentation on how to set this.</p>
    <p>For nonsupporting user agents or clients otherwise, this site defaults to
<i>dark</i>. We do not provide per-site settings, so update your infrastructure
to change it. Alternatively, you can also invert the display colors to simulate
the <i>light</i> color scheme to some extent.</p>
  <p>The color scheme is currently <span id="color-scheme-fallback"
>disabled</span><span id="color-scheme-state"></span><span id=
"color-scheme-value"></span>.</p>
