<p>The <code>Document.referrer</code> property defines the URL of the page from
which you navigated to this page. It is usually blank if you got here by
anything but a link. Conversely, a link with the <code>rel="noreferrer"</code>
attribute can blank this property. Throughout the {{siteClass}}, such links are
preceded by an asterisk (*). User agents can also blank this property.</p>
<p>To see this in effect, navigate to {{data["_media-queries"].body.title}}
using the link just above the page footer, then navigate to this page using its
link found at the same place.</p>
