  <blockquote>
    <p>When a GitHub Pages site is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged
and stored for security purposes, regardless of whether the visitor has signed
into GitHub or not. For more information about GitHub's security practices, see
[<{{htmlAOut}}"https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement"
>GitHub Privacy Statement</a>].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Additionally, GitHub may load some analytics on you. However, we were not
able to reproduce this after our only accidental, unrecorded detection. Rest
assured that it is listed in popular privacy domain blocklists.</p>
  <p><i>As for us, we do no data and will inform you only if otherwise.</i></p>
