  <h3>{{"2023-02-17" | date: formDate}}</h3>
  <p>It may not look like it, but after over four weeks of work, we are finally
releasing the biggest update ever to NET and EDEN Online.</p>
  <p>This update introduces real-mode web applications. These can provide user
experiences close to everyone else's without third-party libraries, much like
the NET-Slides Concept UI we made three years ago. This time however, we have a
real, working albeit less complete example: J-Card Template Update 2. While
our pages are still built with Jekyll, their end result uses 100% in-house
components built from scratch on standard web technologies.</p>
  <p>That alone is one of many changes. We listed over a screenful of logic,
semantic, stylistic, and technical improvements and corrections; plus another
screenful of page creations and edits; all on the Changes page. While working on
the pages, we found a bug in Firefox ESR--our main web browser--and filed it as
#1816270. If you read the report and run the tester, then--yes, we wanted to put
a honk button in the User Agent page, but alas.</p>
  <p>What got us here is an internal plea to replace J-Card Template's tedious
user interface. In it, you scroll down to edit the form, then back up to see the
real-time output. Its replacement divides the window into two parts: one for the
output, and the other for otherwise. Despite still having to scroll in the
latter, the page menu stays in place for section-jumping at any time. We have
written a separate post on J-Card Template Update 2 to announce its
prerelease.</p>
  <p>Lastly, in celebration of EDEN Online reaching a 100-page milestone, we
made it installable for offline access. The process is both explained and
handled by the newly-created NET-Installer, found under NET Services in NET
World. This and its use in J-Card Template mark our entry into Progressive Web
Applications (PWAs), where websites can turn into <i>apps</i>. In other words,
PWAs bypass storefront bureaucracies, install as first-class citizens, and run
on any platform with a supporting web browser.</p>
  <p>With all of that done, we finally felt complete towards every single one of
our work except for NET-Slides, which is just too much of a hassle. <del>There
will definitely be no Updates nor new projects for this year. Instead,</del> we
will fix bugs and respond to mails whenever possible.</p>
