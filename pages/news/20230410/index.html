  <p>Recently, we discovered a technique to achieve full DPI awareness on
CSS-powered platforms. It passes our control of the root font size to the user
agent--and you in turn--and basing all metrices on it instead of absolute units
like pixel and point. This got both NET and Netronic to respect your font size
preference down to their borders, much like adjusting the zoom level of a web
page. Additionally, the root font size is also affected by DPI settings,
effectively making this technique fully DPI aware.</p>
  <p>For Netronic, said technique eliminates the need for DPI variants on its
GTK themes. So, Revision 6 excludes them, <strong>which may break any high DPI
setup</strong>. To migrate, do a clean install to remove those unneeded DPI
variants, then select your preferred color variant with <samp>set a matching
Xfwm4 theme</samp> disabled. For now, window manager (Xfwm4) themes are
unaffected, but expect the same to happen in the future. We apologize for the
inconvenience in return of its benefits.</p>
  <p>For NET, said technique enables DPI awareness on our web applications and
documents.</p>
  <p>Unrelated to this post, this will be our last time working on four
gigabytes of single-channel memory (RAM) at most after nearly 115 months. We
finally gave in and decided to upgrade in hopes to enhance the usability of our
aging Latitude 5480 without affecting our philosophies; eliminate memory
concerns in our activities, not our products. CPU Turbo Boost remains locked and
reserved for the last hurrah.</p>
