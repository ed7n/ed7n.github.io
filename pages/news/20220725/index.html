  <h3>{{"2022-07-25" | date: formDate}}</h3>
  <p>Three years ago, we introduced NET for our web projects starting with
NET-Slides, for which we then made a concept UI envisioning an ideal
desktop-class web application. Last year, we introduced Unagi, NET's web UI
framework, with parts taken from the concept UI. Work on NET then stalled, hence
the same for all web projects including J-Card Template. We have not settled on
infrastructures for web applications, alongside other obligations.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, about ten months ago, our third-party desktop theme stopped
working. Even today, we still have not heard back from its developers, and
long-considered it dead after only nine short months of life. We proceeded to
make our own desktop theme.</p>
  <p>Making a GTK 3 theme requires understanding parts of its widget toolkit
(our PCs run on Xfce desktop environment, which is built on GTK 3). This is
fitting because we too wanted to know how GUI widgets go together. A theme is
defined mainly with CSS, like those on the web, which--despite major
differences--naturalized the adapting of NET to a GTK 3 theme. We took the
skeleton of the default theme since the theme itself is also the least
problematic. Well, GTK 3 turns out to be quite messy--evident from those
stylesheets--but still got what we wanted--sort of.</p>
  <p>Eventually, goals extended from just the theme to a more complete theming
suite, covering Xfce's window manager and notification service, and Wine.
Finally, the Netronic name came in the last days before its silent initial
release.</p>
  <p>We have a more accurate account of Netronic's backstory in its History
page.</p>
  <p>Today, we are officially announcing Update 1 of Netronic. Since the initial
release, this Update brings a new color scheme based on Windows Classic;
supports HDPI (150%), XHDPI (200%), and XXHDPI (300%) displays, plus an MHDPI
(125%) variant of the window manager theme; basic Qt 5 support; and some fixes
and minor edits. For ourselves, we automated much of the building process for
the window manager themes, having saved much of our time and sanity.</p>
  <p>Users migrating from Update 0 Revision 7 must be aware of some breaking
changes. Correcting ourselves following Google's guidelines, HDPI is not 125%
but 150%, and XHDPI is not 150% but 200%, 125% is now MHDPI. We also
title-capitalized the Qt 5 color scheme names like we should have earlier. Our
apologies for any inconvenience.</p>
  <p>We hope that this Update will serve us for the times to come with less
issues, and we will ultimately followup with Xfce's growing transition to GTK
4.</p>
