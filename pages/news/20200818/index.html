  <p><strong>Due to an accidental data erasure, Mæŋ Mini has been deferred to
further notice. We have redesigned the Workstation System to minimize the
impacts from such. There will be no project for 2020. The rest of this post is
now defunct.</strong></p>

  <p>Our original plan for 2020 was to revamp NET-Slides, our presentation
authoring software for the web. Shortly after releasing the latest of its
concept UI (and starting a bit on the backend), we discovered that we can
produce a full-fledged audio player--in the scope of a portable CD player--on
the web. We then decided to set NET-Slides aside in favor of it for its
simplicity, and to provide some practice for NET-Slides' development.</p>
  <p>The Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) format laid the foundation to the
current digital audio culture, though much of it has been either axed or
simplified. To pay a proper homage to the predecessor, we are currently
preparing to provide its near-complete experience--as much as the web platform
allows.</p>
  <p><i>I collect and use portable CD players for reasons redacted,</i> hence
the decision to inspire from them rather than component-sized players.
Considering that the format is already digital in the first place, the
transition should be mostly seamless: minus the tactile aspect. Of course, the
simulated players will not "skip" upon receiving a physical shock.</p>
  <p>We decided to produce three different "models" of the end product: one for
beginners (NET SD-30), one for purists (NET SD-50), and one for enthusiasts (NET
SD-70). In line with this delivery method, each model will not receive any
software updates to themselves, unless they are crucial corrections to serious
problems. Instead, these updates will be brought over to newer models. An
Operating Instructions manual will be included in every model (unless noticed
otherwise).</p>
  <p>We postponed Mæŋ Mini's release date to <del>October 28th the latest</del>
<ins>December</ins>. Basically, this is a strict quality assurance measure, in
order not to repeat the same conventional mistakes. Although to be fair, this is
a relatively-simpler piece of software, it would take us much longer to do the
same on a complex one.</p>
  <p>On its progress: the backend is 99% complete; the LCD module is waiting
for the frontend to finish. The manual is 75% complete; it is missing the
graphic illustrations <del>and a few minor sections</del>. The UI is still at
its infancy. Work is yet to be done to the website and--if time
permits--pseudo-marketing materials.</p>
  <p>Once matured, this project will set the foundation to the reconstruction of
mJPEGfPlay, our ultimate media project (whose name will be changed).</p>
