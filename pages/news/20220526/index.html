  <p><i>Before I start: to those who wrote to me on J-Card Template, I hear you.
There have been requests to fit more cards into a page, implement fold-out
cards, and even templates for MiniDisc. The template was forked from Blaine
Murphy's, and all I did is to add convenience features on top of it. So I will
need to study how he lays down the card. Don't worry: they <strong>will</strong>
come, one at a time, but I can't tell exactly when. And yes, the <code
>LICENSE</code> file needs to be updated.</i></p>
  <p>Calc is currently our oldest active project spanning over eight years of
development. It provides an interface to the host's shell arithmetic features as
a calculator. It has been very obvious to us that said features are not designed
to be calculators, especially with no floating-point arithmetic.</p>
  <p>After dropping Windows in late 2019, we attempted to bring fractional
precision to elementary divisions like <kbd>1 / 9</kbd>. Normally, Calc returns
a <samp>0</samp> for that, while our workaround produces exactly <samp
>0.111111111111111111</samp> instead. As you might have guessed, this approach
is elementary, and extrapolating such to other limitations can get extremely
difficult.</p>
  <p>Overcoming limitations has been a fun(?) part in our projects. In EDENrm:
our Rainmeter skin suite, we made a rudimentary audio player that detects the
end of an audio file with silence. We made similar audio players for PowerPoint
too--without the silence detection. It has indeed been a long time since we
pulled off tricks of those kinds. So, as a successor to Calc, we completed a
math library for Bash (a shell commonly found in Unix-based operating
systems).</p>
  <p>Pnic is independent of Bash's arithmetic features; it does math with string
manipulations and lookup tables, like those hand methods taught in early and
middle schools. While its runtime performance is not very hot, it aims to be
able to work on any real number imaginable--correctly of course. So--in
theory--Pnic can multiply ten-million-digit numbers just fine. And yes, Pnic
does floating-point arithmetic.</p>
  <p>Division however, still relies on Bash's arithmetic features, so you will
have to excuse us while we figure out ways to divide like the rest. For now, we
injected our workaround from Calc, which not only overcame the limits of the
dividend, but also worsens rounding errors.</p>
  <p>But wait, there's more!</p>
  <p>Introducing KESIMATE, a pocket calculator simulator that uses Pnic for its
calculations. In addition to what's already in boring calculator programs, it
simulates power, fraction, and percentage. It also has sign change and square
root features. Only KESIMATE matches the behavior of real, physical pocket
calculators--<i>as far as my collection goes.</i></p>
  <p>You can find the links to the project pages in the home page under the
Projects section.</p>
  <p>Integrating Pnic into Calc could take a lifetime because we will need to
implement an expression parser. So, that is definitely off the table, but we
will still maintain Calc as we see fit.</p>
