  <h3>{{"2023-03-03" | date: formDate}}</h3>
  <p><i>To my fellow J-Card Template users: <strong>check your data
files</strong>. Those made in Revision B and C (February 19th to 24th) are blank
due to a careless mistake in the preserver. We really apologize for any
inconvenience.</i></p>
  <p>Contrary to what we said, we are announcing the launch of yet another web
application, developed out of compassion.</p>
  <p>Originated as a solution to a comically simple problem: viewing a local
text file on a smartphone, NET-Viewer wraps the rich content-handling
capabilities of your web browser into a file viewer. Its main feature is the
ability to adjust the output display, like inverting its colors which can be
useful when viewing PDF documents.</p>
  <p>Based on J-Card Template, it is our first original real-mode web
application (the former is a fork), and--unlike its parent--has a menu bar.
Though, we admit that its control panel interface looks and feels relatively
clunky.</p>
  <p>You can access NET-Viewer in NET World. Try toying around the control
panel while playing a video!</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, we hope not to repeat this for the rest of the year.</p>
  <span>â€”Brendon, founder and sole member.</span>
