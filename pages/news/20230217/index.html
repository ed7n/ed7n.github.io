  <p><i>This post was appended and edited for the release of Update 2.</i></p>

  <h3>{{"2023-03-15" | date: formDate}}</h3>
  <p>The long overdue update to J-Card Template is finally here.</p>
  <p>Originally, we planned to release a finalized version of Revision A as
Update 2, but ended up with drastic changes throughout nine subsequent release
candidates.</p>
  <p>We had issues with the new user interface (UI) mixing field types and sizes
while maintaining its overall usability. In the end, we replaced the mixing with
the uniformity found in modern (mobile) applications. It singularizes the field
presentation and occupies more vertical space, but for the benefit of
decluttering the controls to our desire.</p>
  <p>We also wanted J-Card Template to serve as a basis for our future web
applications, later supplemented by NET-Viewer which is based on it.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, we finalized the five major changes mentioned in our previous
announcement. Most importantly, this release removes Print 2 but not entirely;
we made a forward adapter, so loading an older J-card data file with Print 2
sets the print <samp>Count</samp> option to 2.</p>
  <p>Finally--as a last minute gift--the cover height can be reduced to allow
more text content on the front panel. This is a stopgap solution to the track
fitting issue which plagued J-Card Template throughout its existence. The real
thing will have to wait for Update 3.</p>
  <p>More information follows below. While it was written prior to Update 2,
instructions were updated as necessary.</p>

  <p>The long overdue update to J-Card Template is almost ready, but we want you
to try it out first.</p>
  <p>Revision A is a release candidate for Update 2 that brings five major
changes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span>Short spine support for <i>extraslim</i> cases.</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Its width of 0.4 in or 10.16 mm is not yet finalized. Let us know if
it does not work for you.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span>A new print shop replacing Print 2.</span>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Print 2 has been deprecated and will be removed in Update
2.</strong></li>
        <li>You must disable Print 2 to use the print shop, which does much more
than its predecessor but--admittedly--with some complications.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span>New <em>and</em> updated user interfaces (UIs).</span>
      <ul>
        <li>The new UI is not yet the default for time to try it on your own. In
it, the template output is always displayed, while the form and everything else
remain mostly the same, so it should be easy to adapt to.</li>
        <li>The fieldsets in both UIs are collapsible to reduce the amount of
scrolling.</li>
        <li>You can switch between the two UIs under <kbd><samp>More</samp
>→<samp>View</samp>→<samp>Switch Interface</samp></kbd>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span>Convenient cover image controls.</span>
      <ul>
        <li>We received mails regarding the cover image. While you still have to
load and save them separately, we added controls to do so alongside the data
file for convenience.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span>An offline mode of sorts.</span>
      <ul>
        <li>J-Card Template has been made into a Progressive Web Application
(PWA). You can install it for offline access with the NET-Installer, found under
<kbd><samp>More</samp>→<samp>Application</samp>→<samp>Offline Access</samp></kbd
>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>While we were not able to meet expectations, we hope that this update is
worthwhile, and that you enjoy using it as much as we enjoy working on it.</p>
  <span>—Brendon, founder and sole member.</span>
