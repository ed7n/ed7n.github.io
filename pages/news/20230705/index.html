  <p>Joining the party is our first working iDevice. Previous entries were
already outdated on acquisition; two original iPads and a 3GS did not cut it for
the early-to-mid 2010s. Today, thanks to strange circumstances, we have the
top-of-the-line flagship of 2021, having skipped eleven generations and nine iOS
versions. With this (secondhand) jewel, evaluations on Apple hardware is finally
possible.</p>
  <p>However, Apple's WebKit is one of if not the worst browser engine. Many
macOS users use Chrome in place of Safari. How? Steve Jobs's original intention
for iPhone OS in 2007 was for third-parties to make web applications for Safari,
but we later got the App Store instead for distribution of native, third-party
applications. Later, Apple became conservative towards WebKit's development
allegedly to pull developers into their platform. So Google forked WebKit as
Blink and became king, leaving WebKit in the janitor's.</p>
  <p>But before installing Chrome into your iPhone, we would like to remind you
that WebKit is currently the only engine allowed in App Store applications. This
means that those browsing the web, full or embedded, must be equally dumbed
down. If PWAs become mainstream while WebKit remains immature, iPhone sales may
plummet. However, thanks to antitrust pressure, Apple may be reversing their
anti-competitive web engine policy while readying for the resulting
competition.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, testing J-Card Template and NET-Viewer with Safari (iOS
16.5.1) revealed issues with CSS flexbox direction changes that can be resolved
by rotating the screen. You can reproduce this by toggling <kbd><samp>Reverse
Panels</samp></kbd> while in landscape. Everything else worked okay.</p>
  <p>We will not be pursuing for presence in the App Store; PWAs work fine, just
as Jobs originally intended.</p>
  <p>Sadly, the aforementioned iPads and 3GS turned swollen due to internal
gaseous release inside their batteries, thus are no longer safe, so they had to
be let go. Thankfully, our original iPhone still lives, albeit behind an
activation wall.</p>
