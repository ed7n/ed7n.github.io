  <h3>{{"2021-03-11" | date: formDate}}</h3>
  <p>After over a year of ideation, learning, design, and preseverance, without
any external motivations whatsoever, we are introducing our web UI framework.</p>
  <p>In case you missed it, our original plan for 2020 was to revamp NET-Slides,
our presentation authoring software for the web. We made a non-interactive
concept UI (see its homepage) to showcase what it would've looked and felt like
if completed. We then halted the project due to circumstances already mentioned
previously, but were nevertheless left impressed with our work. So we decided to
design a UI framework based on it.</p>
  <p>A UI framework facilitates the construction of a UI. This can be achieved
in many ways: from boilerplates to utilities.</p>
  <p>This framework has a design language of its own. The conventional flat
design language is an icon of the contemporary culture <i>which I personally
loathe,</i> and that it has a few usability issues. Rather, our design
emphasizes on flat accents and unbalanced highlights, which we see as an extreme
modification of the flat design with heavy inspirations from popular late-90s
graphical desktop environments. While it grants some uniqueness, we acknowledge
that this style might not appeal to some people.</p>
  <p>This framework is universal, lightweight, and works with most sizes from
the iPhone 5 or SE. It offers 20 styles of form fields, optimized for either
desktop- or mobile-class applications, though they all work for both. It doesn't
rely on JavaScript, external libraries, resources, and even development
utilities.</p>
  <p>Technically speaking, it's not really a UI framework but actually a CSS UI
framework. It comes with a bundle of CSS stylesheets rather than a complete
suite, so applications would have to follow some document structure in order to
utilize it. Finally, the stylesheets aren't portable; their class names populate
the global namespace. This is because they're part of NET, which is what EDEN
Online is built on. So applications would have to be built on NET in order to
utilize our web UI framework. If public interest persists, we may mitigate over
these issues.</p>
  <p>Built on NET technology, we decided to name it Unagi, an abbreviation of
Universal NET Application Graphical Interface. You can read more about Unagi and
view its demonstration at EDEN Online, the link to Unagi's homepage can be found
in its Projects page.</p>
  <p>Naturally, we tried Unagi on one of our web applications. Thus, we'd like
to announce an update to J-Card Template, our printable in-browser template for
cassette tape J-cards. For Update 1 Revision 5, it's UI has been redone with
Unagi, making it the first web application to do so. Of course, J-Card Template
represents one of many possible use cases for Unagi. As a reminder, its homepage
can be found at EDEN Online under NET Services.</p>
