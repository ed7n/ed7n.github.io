  <h3>{{"2021-11-23" | date: formDate}}</h3>
  <p>We are bringing an exclusive experience to users of smaller phones. None of
the iPhones--including the original five--qualify for it, but at least one
Galaxy does: the Galaxy Pocket Neo GT-S5310, though we do not recommend using
one today due to its outdated software and unbearingly-weak hardware (<i>yes, I
have one</i>).</p>
  <p><i>EDEN Online mini!</i> is primarily aimed at phones running KaiOS. This
is achieved by reducing its spacer by 24%--and that's mostly it! EDEN Online is
layed out using only a single spacer, so changing its value affects everything
seamlessly. Other websites simply do not have such elegance, sometimes because
they have to cater the old. To be fair, the transition would be more complex if
we divide pages into columns.</p>
  <p>We have procured a 2017 Alcatel 4044V running KaiOS 1.0, which has since
been obsoleted by their successors, thus we can not test it to the full extent.
So, we are inviting those on later KaiOS devices to browse around EDEN Online
and report any issues back to us. A link to our Contact page is at the
bottom.</p>
  <p>Based on Mozilla's Boot to Gecko, KaiOS has been breathing new life into
the feature phone sector with its proprietary, web-powered operating system,
user applications, and storefront: KaiStore. The resulting <i>smart feature</i>
phones usually sports a physical keypad, limited memory, and display resolution
down to QVGA. Over 150 million KaiOS devices have been shipped in over 150
countries. For more information about KaiOS, visit <i>kaiostech.com</i>.</p>
  <p>We are not sponsored by KaiOS in anyway whatsoever; any effort to bring
global software accessibility using open technologies are very welcome.</p>
