  <p>For Update 0 Revision 2, we introduce Pnic's new division algorithm that is
independent of Bash's arithmetic features. This algorithm eliminates the
rounding errors of the old and allows an infinite precision, at the cost of
runtime. It is based on repeated subtractions, which is possibly the worst
method for division--besides guessing--but by conditionally-padding both the
divisor and divident with zeros, we improved both the runtime and precision.</p>
  <p>Alongside this news: we revised KESIMATE to use this algorithm, kept the
option to use the old algorithm for those who rely on its quirks, and completed
much of the documentation.</p>
  <p>Pnic's main goal is to perform the four arithmetic operations by string
manipulations and lookup tables, and this new algorithm completes it. Now, there
is much more in the field of mathematics outside of these operators, and there
are many more platforms outside of Bash. We would be glad to expand Pnic in such
ways as we see fit.</p>
