  <h3>{{"2022-12-31" | date: formDate}}</h3>
  <p>This year has been very eventful to say the least.</p>
  <p>For us, we introduced Pnic in late May. It is a Bash script for
trillion-digit arithmetic calculations. Initially, division's (/) limited
precision prevented Pnic's true completion. This was quickly resolved with its
new and current algorithm. Launched alongside Pnic was KESIMATE, our pocket
calculator simulator powered by Pnic. However, because we slouched on its
launch, we would like to insert the following addendum to <i>We Made Our Own
Calculator</i>, the post that launched both projects.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>KESIMATE simulates a real pocket calculator authentically down to the
display blink, while remaining relatively lightweight for life by staying
independent of user interface (UI) libraries. It is also very small and
portable: only 33 kiB including Pnic, and you can use it on anything that runs
Bash. Finally, like with any good shell scripts, customizing its key bindings is
as easy as editing a text file.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>KESIMATE is not perfect however: its performance on (square) roots is
abysmal, and its capabilities are limited for many. We can also not say whether
it is ready for production use. On our end, KESIMATE has been employed as our
software calculator since its launch, even for crucial finances. It is through
this that we found and fixed its and Pnic's bugs. When all is set, we may
proceed to turn them into binaries to squeeze every last bit of performance.</p>
  <p>Earlier this month, we reached our 14th anniversary, but were busy with
various activities.</p>
  <p>First, we discovered that--in Bash--it is faster to detect a variable's
occupancy with its length rather than itself. This is opposite to other
languages like C and Java, but this ultimately depends on how they are
implemented. We refactored the scripts of all active projects while going over
each to fix any bugs. This resulted in three revision releases today.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, we found a bug in Bash in which the length of some variables are
returned incorrectly. This affected about 2% of our refactors, including Pnic.
We filed a report as #110799 and it was since marked as done. Once a fix becomes
available, we will wait for about half-a-year before revising those affected by
it.</p>
  <p>Second, we acquired our first Android tablet after at least seven years. We
also made changes to our Android software infrastructure across all active
devices to turn them--especially the tablet--into mobile versions of our aging
PCs using only FOSS. While we are still undetermined on our entry into Android
development, we are fascinated on how entry-level models have gone a long way
from being unusable to adequate, minus their cameras. As for our PCs, we hope to
replace our Latitude 5480 in four years (totaling to nine) before demoting it
from Primary to Secondary.</p>
  <p>Lastly, we spun off one of our internal Bash scripts into a public project.
SheFF--short for Shell FFmpeg--prompts the user with options to build their
FFmpeg command, FFmpeg being the multimedia multi-tool used by YouTube and
NASA's Perseverance rover in Mars. Colloquially, SheFF is a video
converter. Before developing software, media transcoding (conversion) was part
of our production activities since the beginning, and finding the right tools
was not easy. So, not only is SheFF a convenience for us, but also a throwback
to our media production years, even though it missed our 14th anniversary by a
few weeks.</p>
  <p>As this year comes to a sighful close, we are looking forward to see what
2023 will bring. You can help by actually looking after one another; not faking
it. Likewise, we greatly appreciate those who reached out to us, particularly
for J-Card Template--we should really work on it soon. With only seven minutes
to New Year's Eve (UTC) at this time of writing, we wish you a great 2023.</p>
