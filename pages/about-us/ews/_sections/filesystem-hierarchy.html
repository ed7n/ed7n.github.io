<p>We designed our own filesystem hierarchy to tighten our knowledge of each and
every file including directories and links. We only clutter our desktop during
work and only if necessary, and flush our downloads regularly by moving them to
their appropriate place. We use a RAM disk as a semi-volatile workspace to
reduce disk wear, for archive extractions, small downloads, and other
intermediate storage needs. Occassionally, we do a monthly backup of our primary
storage.</p>
<p>{{siteData.orgNameShort}} Workstation Folder Hierarchy (EWFH) started in 2011
with the intended use of Windows Vista's user shell folders. Today, it spans
multiple disks and partitions, flagged with either file categories or archive
levels.</p>
