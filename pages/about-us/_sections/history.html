<p>We were founded on December 5th, 2008 with the debut of long lost <i>Shoot
Brendon</i>, an interactive PowerPoint game in which the player taps on my face
in each slide to advance. To reflect on its professionalism, our brand was used
alongside my name. Its success made us popular within classmates.</p>
<p>As {{siteData.orgName}}, we spent our first seven years mostly on media
production, with at least three PowerPoint games and five collaborative short
films including 2013's <i>Super Milk</i>. 2017 was the last time we worked on
PowerPoint media, with the aptly-named [<{{htmlAOut}}"{{gitHome}}/legacy-ppt/tree/master/FINALPPT"
>FINALPPT project</a>] placed on hold.</p>
<p>As a pseudonym to myself, we started developing software in 2011 with <i
>EE_iNSOFT</i> launched to no fanfare the next year. It took us until 2018 for
our next success with [{%include a-page.html key="mjpegfplay"%}], whose showcase
video won first place. We were offline for much of the 2010s with some presences
on social media before finally launching {{siteTitle}} right before 2020. We
have been developing our web infrastructure since.</p>
<p>Having lived much in <span id="target-1">isolation</span>, it should be no
surprise that I have been running {{siteData.orgNameShort}} by myself.</p>
