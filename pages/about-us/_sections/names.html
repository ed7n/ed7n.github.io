<p>ED7 is purely an identifier and has no meaning otherwise. It originated in
2004 as ED [iːdi], then appended with 7 in 2007 as it was my favorite number at
the time.</p>
<p>Due to the lengthiness of {{siteData.orgName}}, and the unintentional
pronunciation of ED7 as <i>add seven</i> [ɛd sɛvən] instead of <i>E.D. seven</i>
[iːdi sɛvən], {{siteData.orgNameShort}} was created in 2013 with first two
characters of each word. It is pronounced like the English word <i>eden.</i></p>
