<p><i>Recursion</i> is a way to solve a problem by solving a smaller instance of
it; divide and conquer. Observe the following procedure:</p>
<figure>
  <pre>#lang racket
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>
  <figcaption>[<{{htmlAOut}}"https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>] procedure that
calculates the [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"
>factorial</a>] of <var>n</var>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><code>factorial</code> passes a smaller <var>n</var> to itself recursively,
until <var>n</var> is 0, with which the <i>base case</i> is reached. <code
>1</code>--the factorial for 0--is then returned to the caller, to be multiplied
with its <var>n</var> of 1. The result is then retuned to its caller, to be
multiplied with its <var>n</var> of 2. This continues until the original caller
returns the final result.</p>
