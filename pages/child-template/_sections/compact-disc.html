  <p>The <i>Compact Disc Digital Audio System</i> offers the best possible sound
reproduction â€” on a <s>small, convenient</s><sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup>
sound-carrier unit. The Compact Disc's superior performance is the result of
<span class="highlight">laser-optical scanning combined with digital
playback</span>, and is independent of the technology used in making the
original recording. This recording technology is identified on the back cover by
a three-letter code.</p>

  <p>In storing and handling the Compact Disc, you should apply the same care as
with conventional records. No further cleaning will be necessary if the Compact
Disc is <strong><em>always held by the edges</em></strong> and is replaced in
its case directly after playing. Should the Compact Disc become soiled by
fingerprints, dust, or dirt, it can be wiped (<strong><em>always in a straight
line, from center to edge</em></strong>) with a clean and lint-free, soft, dry
cloth. No solvent or abrasive cleaner should ever be used on the disc. If you
follow these suggestions, the Compact Disc will provide a lifetime of <i>pure</i
> listening enjoyment.</p>
