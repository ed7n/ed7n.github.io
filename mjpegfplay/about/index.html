<section>
  <p>MotionJPEG File-Play ({{data["mjpegfplay"].body.title}}) is an image file
sequence player with audio. A sequence consists of a set of numbered image
files, optional numbered audio files (for solo or concurrent playback), and a
metadata file. {{data["mjpegfplay"].body.title}} handles anything from
slideshows to feature films at any resolution and framerate, though extremely
constrained by its backend and the client hardware.</p>
  <p>Image files are independent and thus can be quickly accessed at any state.
This allows for random access and trickplay features--prominent in analog video
formats--at the cost of higher space requirements.</p>
