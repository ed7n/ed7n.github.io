  <p>We now describe the basic design.</p>
  <p>First, three<sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup> independent image readers,
each on their own sequence of image files. A video renderer selects the
appropriate frame from its reader, then performs post-processing--including
scaling--prior to display.</p>
  <p>Second, one audio mixer for up to 127 simultaneous streams. Sources are
independently controlled--including seeking--and are mixed with a simple
additive method. The mix is multiplied by the user-defined level before reaching
the audio hardware.</p>
  <p>Third, two independent timers: one clocks the video renderer to update the
display accordingly, and the other clocks the orchestrator to update the
playback model and synchronize the video to the audio.</p>
  <p>Lastly, the same orchestrator controls the above modules on user and
playback events. For instance, if the user taps <kbd><samp>Pause</samp></kbd>,
then the orchestrator signals the video timer and audio mixer to hold their
activities.</p>
  <p>On top of everything, two user interfaces plug into the orchestrator, of
which the other is enabled only with the <code>--console</code> option.</p>
  <p>There are two special orchestrators: the first one toggles the video clock
at the times specified in the sequence metadata; the other one plays numbered
audio files sequentially rather than concurrently, like a playlist.</p>
