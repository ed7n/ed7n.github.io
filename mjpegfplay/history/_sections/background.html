<p>In Winter 2018, a new personal project component was added to UBC's CPSC 210,
replacing the so-called Android project. This time, we were given the freedom to
do anything we want, so long weekly requirements are met.</p>
<p>My decision of making an image sequence player for Java actually came from a
JavaScript project I did for Langara's CPSC 1045 two years back, which also had
a similar project component albeit much watered-down. It was when I made my very
first iteration of MotionJPEG playback, in which each frame is a JPEG image
file. I managed to get it clocked nicely at 15 fps--it was much easier compared
to what is here!</p>
<p>Over time, I would visit that project every now and then. I managed to strip
off the MotionJPEG part out of its single, 2000-line JS file, and turn it into a
standalone project. By that time, I had already taken an Object-Oriented
Programming course, and had been fond of Java as a well-documented programming
language--for the most part. This meant forgetting JavaScript, and hence no
longer being able to pick up the pieces left in it.</p>
<p>By the second week, we had to decide on our projects. I thought that it may
be a good idea to do something equivalent to simple-comms. If I can get a
messaging application working in a Summer, why not do the same here? As a head
start, I already had a working audio engine and a small API for reading {{
siteData.orgNameShort}} configuration files (similar to JSON but--according to
my peers--much, much worse). With that, I decided to breathe new life to my work
on MotionJPEG.</p>
