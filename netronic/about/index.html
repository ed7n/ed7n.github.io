  <p>{{data["netronic"].body.title}} is a desktop theming suite for [<{{htmlAOut
}}"https://xfce.org">Xfce 4.18</a>], alongside [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://gtk.org"
>GTK</a>], [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://doc.qt.io/qt-5">Qt 5</a>], and [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://www.winehq.org"
>Wine</a>] applications running on top of it.</p>
  <p>Visually, it follows the NET design, which basically features flat accents
and straight, beveled borders, which we see as a middle ground between flat
design and skeuomorphism. Despite being unique, it might not appeal to some
people.</p>
  <p>Its GTK themes--modified from Adwaita--removed as many animations, shadows,
and workarounds or hacks as possible while retaining its selectors. The result
is a frilless stylesheet that should work just as well.</p>
