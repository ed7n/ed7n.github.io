  <h3>Notice</h3>
  <p>Xfce 4.18 resolved some significant issues with [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libhandy"
>Handy</a>] and GTK 4, and we followed it with initial support. So if you have
issues with either, update both Xfce and {{data["netronic"].body.title}}
first.</p>

  <h3>Specific Troubleshooting</h3>
  <p>If you extracted the theme files elsewhere and an application is not themed
right, then ensure that it can and may read there; check its [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://apparmor.net/"
>AppArmor</a>] profile. Some applications look only in <code
>/usr/share/themes</code>, where system-managed themes are installed. Installing
{{data["netronic"].body.title}} there should be fine.</p>
  <p>If a Handy application follows your dark color scheme but not the theme
altogether, then either rename the theme or make a symbolic link to it, as long
as its name does not end with <i>-dark</i>. This workaround foregoes system-wide
<i>dark mode.</i></p>
  <p>If you see any odd magenta-colored widgets, then you have discovered one of
our placeholders for the unknowns; please [{%include a-page.html key="_contact"
html="let us know"%}] about them.</p>
