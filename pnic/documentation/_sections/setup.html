  <h3>Division</h3>
  <p>Optionally, you can set the division algorithm and precision either within
or outside of {{data["pnic"].body.title}}. See the script for names.</p>
  <p>The Pad, Count, Shift (<code>pcs</code>) algorithm allows for any
precision. It is not bound by Bash's limits, but a large precision like <code
>9999</code> can make division unusable. The default precision should suffice,
so change it only when required by your application. This algorithm is the
default as we recommend using it.</p>
  <p>The Padding Dividend (<code>pdv</code>) algorithm is still available, with
which your precision setting does not apply as it is fixed. Note that this
algorithm is very prone to rounding errors.</p>
