    <p>{{data["pnic"].body.title}}'s goal is to at least perform the four basic
arithmetic operations without directly using the host's arithmetic features.
Currently, that host is Bash.</p>
    <p>{{data["pnic"].body.title}} is a math library for use in Bash scripts.
All operations except for shifts are done with string manipulations and lookup
tables; they are mostly independent of both Bash's arithmetic<sup><a href=
"#note-1">[1]</a></sup> and pattern matching<sup><a href="#note-2">[2]</a></sup>
features. Thus, {{data["pnic"].body.title}} can work on numbers way beyond
native limits: over twenty digits in an 8-bit environment.</p>

      <li id="note-1">Bash's arithmetic feature is used in occupancy
conditionals. Substring expansion parameters--for example--are automatically
arithmetic in Bash, but {{data["pnic"].body.title}} does no such operations in
them.</li>

character, for sanity's sake.</li>
