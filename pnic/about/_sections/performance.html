<p>{{data["pnic"].body.title}} implements operators on top of those built into
Bash. Thus, it is slower than lower-level equivalents, which have different use
cases than those for {{data["pnic"].body.title}}.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, let <var>m</var> be the length of the longer operand,
and <var>n</var> be that of the shorter.</p>
<ul class="headered">
  <li><span
>Addition</span><span
>O(<var>m</var>)</span></li>
  <li><span
>Subtraction</span><span
>O(<var>m</var>)</span></li>
  <li><span
>Multiplication</span><span
>O(<var>m</var><var>n</var>)</span></li>
  <li><span
>Division</span><span
>O(<var>m</var><var>p</var>/<var>n</var>) where <var>m</var> is the dividend,
<var>n</var> is the divisor, and <var>p</var> is the precision.</span></li>
  <li><span
>Comparison</span><span
>O(<var>m</var>)</span></li>
  <li><span
>Shift</span><span
>O(<var>n</var>), where <var>n</var> is the distance.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These are very rough estimates with underlying operations unaccounted for.
During testing, multiplication performed much slower than the rest. Division can
perform even slower with large precision.</p>
