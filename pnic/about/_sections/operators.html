<p>Its implementations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication are based on
hand algorithms taught during early and middle schools, how these operations are
divisible into simpler problems, and how the algorithms are scalable to any real
number imaginable.</p>
<p>However, the same can not be said for division, <i>as I am yet to know how a
divisor can be split into singular units</i>. Instead, it divides by repeatedly
subtracting the divisor from the dividend, padding each with zeros to both
improve its runtime and precision.</p>
<p>Comparison and shift operators are added for convenience. While they can be
done with the above four, their implementations are independent of them. In
particular, the shift operators are bound to Bash's arithmetic limits.</p>
