  <p>A binary digit (bit) has two symbols: 0 and 1. Eight of them together can
produce 256 unique combinations of 0s and 1s. When used to represent numbers
zero and onwards, the largest is 255, which is too small in many cases.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, a number can also be represented as an array of digits, each
of which is addressable by an index of the above representation. In other words,
each of the 256 combinations of 0s and 1s corresponds to a digit index.
Therefore, the largest number representable this way is 256 digits.<sup><a href=

  <p>However, this non-native numerical representation means that operators must
be implemented in software and run much slower. Memory is required to store
those implementations as well as working numbers. Such concerns are secondary to
{{data["pnic"].body.title}}, and that we recommend those on critical
infrastructure to seek low-level solutions instead.</p>
