<p>{{data["jcard-template"].body.title}} uses only standard web technologies,
and the first to use our [{%include a-page.html key="unagi"%}] framework. Its
pages--including the template--are defined in HTML, styled in CSS, and
programmed in JavaScript. It is built with [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://jekyllrb.com"
>Jekyll</a>] on the same backend as that for {{siteTitle}}. So naturally, it
also uses [<{{htmlAOut}}"https://shopify.github.io/liquid">Liquid</a>] and [<{{
htmlAOut}}"https://yaml.org">YAML</a>] but only during development.</p>
<p>Much of {{data["jcard-template"].body.title}} are made in-house from scratch,
while the core design and template definition remain attributed to the original
version.</p>
<p>Alongside [{%include a-page.html key="viewer"%}], they are testbeds to
generalize our web application infrastructure for future projects.</p>
