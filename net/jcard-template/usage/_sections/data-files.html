<p>Cover images are not included in the J-card data file due to a limitation of
the web platform.<sup><a href="#note-a">[a]</a></sup></p>
<p>A J-card data file created with Update 1 works with Update 2 and vice versa.
However, while <i>Print 2</i> is carried over to Update 2, it is otherwise
unsupported to make way for the print shop. Likewise, entries not in the target
version are not recognized there.</p>
<p>A data file bears the <code>.jcard.json</code> file name extension. If you
are to open one with a text editor, we highly recommend to run it through a JSON
formatter first. A prettified JSON text works just as well as otherwise.</p>
