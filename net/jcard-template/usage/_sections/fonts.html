  <h3>Font Family</h3>
  <p>Any font supported by your web browser can be used. As far as we know,
there are no ways to reliably-obtain a list of available fonts. You may be able
to retrieve such a list in your browser settings.</p>
  <p>{{data["jcard-template"].body.title}} comes included with Alte Haas Grotesk
and uses it by default.</p>

  <h3>Font Sizes</h3>
  <p>Font sizes are measured in points (pt).</p>
  <p>Your web browser may scale them to match your preference. <strong>This also
affects the template.</strong> For instance: on Android, if you set the system
font size to <kbd><samp>Small</samp></kbd>, and enabled automatic font sizing in
Firefox, then the same twelve-point font appears relatively smaller than
otherwise.</p>
  <p>You can correct this error by adjusting the correction factor under <kbd
><samp>More</samp>→<samp>Application</samp>→<samp>Font size factor</samp></kbd
>.</p>
