  <p>The goal is to print various J-cards on one sheet until it can no longer
fit anymore. This requires refeeding which public printers may not allow. In
that case, you can only print multiples of a J-card.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Sheet Path</h3>
  <p>The first task is to know how the sheet goes through the printer, so that
subsequent printouts will not be at the wrong places. You can place a mark on a
corner of the sheet for reference, print a blank document on it, then look for
your mark, observing its position and side. Repeat until you are confident.</p>

  <h3>Margin Mode</h3>
  <p>Before printing on a blank sheet, set the <b>margin</b> mode first. If <em
>all</em> J-cards for that sheet have the <em>same</em> width, then you may use
<kbd><samp>Variable</samp></kbd>. Otherwise, <kbd><samp>Half</samp></kbd> works
for all cases. Once set, do not change it for this sheet.</p>

  <h3>Start Index</h3>
  <p>The next task is to master in setting the <b>start</b> index.</p>
  <p>Formally, the start index for the <var>n</var>-th J-card is defined as the
following equation:</p>

    <{{htmlImgMono}}"res/equation.png" alt="Explained below." />
  </figure>
  <p>In prose, it is at least the sum of <b>counts</b> from all previous
J-cards, and the <b>start</b> index of the first one.</p>
  <p>The following example cases describe how it is ideally set.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>If the sheet is <b>blank</b>, then set the start index to <kbd
>1</kbd>.</span></li>
    <li><span>If you printed <b>one</b> of the first J-card, then set the start
index to <kbd>2</kbd>.</span></li>
    <li><span>If you printed <b>one</b> of the first J-card, and <b>one</b> of
the second J-card, then set the start index to <kbd>3</kbd>.</span></li>
    <li><span>If you printed <b>one</b> of the first, and <b>two</b> of the
second, then set the start to <kbd>4</kbd>.</span></li>
    <li><span>If you printed <b>one</b> of the first, <b>two</b> of the second,
and <b>four</b> of the third, then set the start to <kbd>8</kbd>.</span></li>
    <li><span>If you printed <b>one</b> of first, <b>one</b> of second, and <b
>four</b> of third, then set start to <kbd>7</kbd>.</span></li>
    <li><span>If you printed <b>one</b> of first, <b>two</b> of second, and <b
>three</b> of third, then set start to <kbd>7</kbd>.</span></li>
    <li>Finally, if the sheet is <b>full</b>, then stop printing on it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you understand it, you should also understand that the first start
index does not need to be <kbd>1</kbd>, nor do you have to follow the J-card
order above. If the slot defined by that index is available, then you can print
a J-card on it.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Overprinting</h3>
  <p>Once you completed both tasks, you should be able to prevent J-cards from
overprinting one another. However, if you desire this effect, then you can set
the <b>opacity</b> to adjust the print density.</p>
