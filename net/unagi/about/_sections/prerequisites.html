<p>For {{data["unagi"].body.title}}, we follow a policy of continuous
advancements in software technologies. Therefore, deprecated and legacy user
agents are not supported.</p>
<p>{{data["unagi"].body.title}} is designed mainly for Firefox (Gecko)<sup><a
href="#note-4">[4]</a></sup> and Chromium (Blink), and is also tested on
Epiphany (WebKit). We guess that any one that is based on one of those three and
is at most three years of age should work.<sup><a href="#note-5">[5]</a></sup
