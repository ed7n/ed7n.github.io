  <p>Viewing a local text file on my Android devices was a painful experience,
and yet we call them smart. Go figure. WebView does not follow my color scheme
preference, Bromite--also based on Chromium--does not display it in monospaced
font, and Fennec--based on Firefox (Fenix)--does not provide any interface at
all. Additionally, my only Notes application crashes from its large size,<sup><a
href="#note-a">[a]</a></sup> and using Termux is clunky. Why bother installing
another application just to view this file when I can make a viewer that works
for everyone with a web browser? And just like that, {{data["viewer"].body.title
}} is born.</p>
  <p>I started with a copy of [{%include a-page.html key="jcard-template"%}],
stripped all of its application-specific features and generalized the remains to
make way for the future. Along the way, I decided to add support for media files
and especially PDF documents. The end goal is for us to benefit from its output
display adjustment controls.</p>
  <p>Now, viewing a local text file on my Android devices is as easy as
uploading it to a web page. Plus, I can enable the dark color scheme and
monospaced font, then adjust the output display to my comfort. Now <em>that</em>
is smart.</p>
