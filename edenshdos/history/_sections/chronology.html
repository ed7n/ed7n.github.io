<p>The chronological origin of the project remains very fuzzy in my memory, and
I used not to archive old versions of my projects to save space. My
smaller-brain, happier-life self thought: <q>what's the point keeping them
anyways when the newer versions are better?</q> Well it turns out that they
serve as a memory trip, and who knows that some of the older algorithms works
better in other situations? Every solution to Computer Science problems has
their own benefits and drawbacks. Anyways:</p>
