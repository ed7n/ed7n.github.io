  <p>Back when I started using Linux in late 2012, most of the answers to my
questions are command lines. That was when my habit of using the terminal began
to develop, which eventually led to a problem: I had been entering the same
lines over and over. Since I had some experience with scripting on Windows, I
thought that it would be great if I do the same on Bash to automate most of my
redundancies. Thus, EDENsh was born--somewhere in 2013 I think.<sup><a href=
"#note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
  <p>Shortly after, EDENsh got ported to Windows as EDENdos. This port initially
had more scripts as I integrated some of my previous works done before EDENsh.
Today, I work on both ports in parallel.</p>

back in September 2013 to get admitted for my last two years of high school, and
that December 2012 was when I used Ubuntu for the very first time.</li>
