<p>Comparing the scripts (of similar file names) for EDENsh and EDENdos
line-by-line, you can tell that one may seem like a clone of the other. This is
the case for EDENsh, whose base codes are copy-pasted from EDENdos but with
changes, especially wrapping double quotes (") around echo lines. This is done
so that I am not confused between the two, though this programming practice is
unused outside this project.</p>
<p>Version codes are assigned in parallel to each other. That is, any new
version code assignments done to a component of EDENdos has to reflect the same
component in EDENsh, if present, unless not a single byte has changed.</p>
