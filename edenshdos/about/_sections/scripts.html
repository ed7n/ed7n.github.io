<p>The collection of scripts contained within {{data["edenshdos"].body.title}}
are focused at automating my personal system maintenance routines (cleanup,
update). Such scripts, and the majority of the rest can be run unattended. A few
others require user interaction, usually prompting for arguments that affect the
behaviors of scripts.</p>
<p>Most of the scripts are merely frontends sitting on top of the actual worker
programs doing the work. With that said, you can and may make your own scripts
and not use {{data["edenshdos"].body.title}} at all--if you have the skills and
the will; you can always use what I provide here if you do not want to do all
the work yourself.</p>
