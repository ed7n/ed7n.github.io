<p>For use in our Java projects.</p>
<p>This is actually the second iteration of the API. The first one found in [{%
include a-page.html key="mjpegfplay"%}] is either not well-made or is too
focused towards the application. Only <code>CSSColor</code> made its way here,
and maybe some more from it will follow.</p>
<p>This is an in-house API, so online documentation is limited.</p>
