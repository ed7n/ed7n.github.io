  <h3>REMs</h3>
  <p>REM or remark statements do not make part of the layout metadata, but are
used for annotations, and--more often--non-standard metadata such as genre. They
can be placed anywhere in a cuesheet. However, {{data["qedit"].body.title}}
groups them by their location in the same order as how they are found.
Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>REMs before the first TRACK will be placed at the top of the
cuesheet.</li>
    <li>REMs after TRACK but before INDEX will be placed after FLAGS but before
track CD-Text and PREGAP.</li>
    <li>REMs between two INDEXes will be placed as they are found.</li>
    <li>REMs after INDEX but before TRACK will be placed before POSTGAP and
FILE.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>Others</h3>
  <p>Occassionally, non-standard metadata statements do not use REM.
Consequently, cuesheets that contain them are also non-standard. {{data["qedit"
].body.title}} handles them similarly to how it does with REMs, but at a lower
priority. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Others before the first TRACK will be placed after session CD-Text but
before FILE.</li>
    <li>Others after TRACK but before INDEX will be placed after track CD-Text
but before PREGAP.</li>
    <li>Others between two INDEXes will be placed after REMs.</li>
    <li>Others after INDEX but before TRACK will be placed after REMs but before
POSTGAP and FILE.</li>
  </ul>
