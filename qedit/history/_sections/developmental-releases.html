  <p>Development A was rushed to terror but worked. It accepts as a directory
input path to process cuesheets recursively. QEdit was described as <q>hopefully
a CUE sheet editor.</q></p>

  <p>Development B introduced actions, starting with <code>pregapToIndex00</code
>, its reverse counterpart, and <code>print</code>.</p>

  <p>Development C improved the cuesheet parser with full INDEX support, brought
more actions including <code>--AdjustTime</code>, and removed the directory
recursion function.</p>

  <p>Development D marked this project as the first to have its own section in
the {{siteClass}}, the first to integrate with my Java API, and the first to
support REM statements. The cuesheet checker was matured to comply with most of
the original specifications.</p>

  <p>Development F featured a word-detecting cuesheet parser, remedy
suggestions, and custom statement support. The then renamed <code
>shift-times</code> action can now use the absolute-first INDEX as the frame
offset. This is useful for extractions that exclude content prior to the first
TRACK--such as HTOA--but produce the correct cuesheets. Additive PREGAP-INDEX
conversions move as much time to targets as possible, even if they already
exist.</p>
