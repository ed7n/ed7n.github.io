<p>In late March 2019, I noticed that CDEx couldn't differentiate between PREGAP
and INDEX 00. They specify the gap before INDEX 01: the start of a TRACK's
content. PREGAP inserts such gap artificially when they are not in the audio
stream, while INDEX 00 specifies the time code at which the gap resides in the
audio stream. CDEx includes these gaps during extraction but erroneously uses
PREGAP. There seemed to be no easy way to convert them to INDEX 00. So I set out
to make my own solution. Thus, four hours later, QEdit was born for that one
purpose.</p>
