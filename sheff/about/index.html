    <p>{{data["sheff"].body.title}} is a shell frontend to FFmpeg. Colloquially,
it may be described as a video converter, which is what it is most commonly used
for.</p>

    <h3>For End Users</h3>
    <p>{{data["sheff"].body.title}}'s user interface is menu-driven. Users are
prompted with options to build their FFmpeg command, which is to be run, edited
(temporarily), or saved as a shell script. It softens the hardships from using
the FFmpeg command line tools, and possibly demonstrates the basic structure of
said commands. Options resemble their FFmpeg counterparts, so some familiarity
is recommended.</p>

    <h3>For Developers</h3>
    <p>{{data["sheff"].body.title}} is designed to be quickly extensible. Its
menu-driven user interface complements its array-centric data structure. In
addition to menu selections, there are utility functions for reading integers
(within a range), booleans, and times; as well as those that interact with
underlying data. With this power, adding a single-argument option can take only
thirty seconds.</p>

    <h3>For Us</h3>
    <p>{{data["sheff"].body.title}} became part of the [{%include a-page.html
key="ews"%}] in early 2022 as EWS FFmpeg Helper. As such, parts of the
infrastructure can be seen in its code. Its growing complexity spun it off into
its own project. Its proven usefulness over the year publicized it to what it is
today. We named it {{data["sheff"].body.title}} because of its likeness to a
restaurant chef (notice the pronunciation), with FFmpeg being the kitchen, and
the user as the customer. Though initially, its name was inspired from [<{{
htmlAOut}}"https://github.com/WinFF/winff">WinFF</a>], a graphical FFmpeg
frontend.</p>

    <h3><i>For Me</i></h3>
    <p><i>This project is a throwback to one of my longest-running computer
activities. I have used at least a dozen of converters--including [<{{htmlAOut}}
"https://www.xmedia-recode.de/en">XMedia Recode</a>]--before finally learning to
use FFmpeg's command line tools. With this frontend, I hope to have made
everyone's workflow a bit easier, just like those before me.</i></p>
