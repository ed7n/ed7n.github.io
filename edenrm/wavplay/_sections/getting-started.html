  <h3>Consider the files you want WavPlay to play.</h3>
  <p>Hover over the <kbd><samp>[ Directory ]</samp></kbd> button, a tool tip
should appear showing a directory path. By default, it is designated to your
desktop, so make sure that your files are there.</p>

  <h3>Consider the sequence you want WavPlay to follow.</h3>
  <p>Rename your files into ascending numbers, starting from <code>1.wav</code>,
the first song in your sequence. For example, a sequence of twenty songs should
have files <code>1.wav</code>, <code>2.wav</code>, â€¦, and <code>20.wav</code
>.</p>
  <p>You may do the renaming prior to moving the files into the destination
folder.</p>

  <h3>Consider the behavior you want WavPlay to have.</h3>
  <p>Unlike most--if not all--audio players, WavPlay plays only one file before
requiring your action, even if you have prepared a sequence of--for
example--twenty files you want it to play continuously. This is the standard
behavior under Rainmeter's sound playback limitations.</p>
  <p>This highlights the usefulness of WavPlay's Automatic Playback Control
feature, which can be engaged by tapping on the <kbd><samp>[ AutoPlay ]</samp
></kbd> button. With this, WavPlay will detect for silence before performing the
next appropriate action on its own. Ensure that the number of tracks shown in
the <kbd><samp>[ Tracks = ** ]</samp></kbd> button matches your sequence so that
it knows when to stop.</p>

  <p>This concludes the end of the start guide. The rest of WavPlay should be
able to help you with their tool tips, they include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing a custom file.</li>
    <li>Setting a custom directory.</li>
    <li>Adjusting silence detection parameters (usually not needed).</li>
  </ul>
