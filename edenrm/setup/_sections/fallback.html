>Rainmeter 4.0 Release</a>]:</span>
  <blockquote>
    <h3>Important change to supported versions of Microsoft Windows</h3>
    <p>Due to current and future improvements and additions to functionality,
which will require the latest version of the Direct2D/DirectWrite graphical
engines:</p>
    <p>As of Rainmeter 4.0, Windows XP and Windows Vista are no longer
supported.</p>
    <p>Rainmeter 4.0 requires at least Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 and the
Platform Update applied. These should have been automatically applied several
years ago by Windows Update, but if you have Windows Update turned off you may
need to get and apply these updates manually. Windows versions later than
Windows 7 are fully supported.</p>
    <p>If you are on Windows XP or Windows Vista, and can't or don't wish to
upgrade, you will need to stay on the 3.3.3 Release version of Rainmeter.</p>
